# Record-Low-Shutdown-Dose-Achievement

### Challenge

Assumed leadership of a high-risk Radiological Controls division leading into a major facility shutdown (world's oldest operational reactor), historically associated with peak dose rates and high exposure risks.

### Strategy

Implemented a data-driven, graded work-control methodology. This involved mandating explicit permissions for radiological entry points and compressing critical maintenance into minimal operational windows to limit personnel exposure time.

### Outcome

This strategic operational planning and adherence to strict Human Performance (HU) principles achieved the **lowest shutdown cumulative dose** recorded in the facility's five-year history, setting a new safety standard and aligning foundational operational safety with stringent future benchmarks.
